== What does Golfml !CourseWriter do? ==

The purpose of the application is to:

Write new golfml files
Import and display golfml files
Import, edit and save golfml files.
== What is a golfml file? ==

It is a plain-text XML file designed to store information about Golf Courses, Golf Players and Golf Matches.

== How can I make a new golfml file? ==

When Golfml !CourseWriter starts up, the first screen gives simple instructions on how to make a new golfml file.

You will need:

  * A scorecard from the Golf Club with the tees and distances, !StrokeIndexes and Pars for each hole.  You can sometimes see these published on the web.
  * The Course Rating and Slope Rating for each tee of each course in the club (it should be on the scorecards; look for the terms 'VC' and 'VS')
  * Details about the Club's location and facilities offered by the club.

== How can I edit a golfml file? ==

On the File menu, click 'Import golfml file...'.  After a short delay, the golfml file data will load.

You can then add, delete, change and edit anything you like, and when you are done, click the 'Save all data to golfml file' button.

Note: If you save the file under the same name you loaded it, the new file will always overwrite the old one.

== Can I change a golfml file myself using a text editor? ==

Yes.  That is one of the strengths of XML as a data format, but it is safer to edit via Golfml !CourseWriter (Menu: File/Import golfml file...)

== How can I display a scorecard on a web page using Golfml !CourseWriter? ==

 * Make or import a course (e.g. 'mycourse.xml')
 * In the Mode menu, click 'Course + Generic Scorecard stylesheet'
Click the 'Save all data to Golfml File'
Use the suggested filename (e.g. 'scorecard_mycourse.xml') to save the golfml file to disk
 * On your website, add the saved golfml file and also the following 2 files (available in the source section):
  # scorecard.xsl
  # golfml.css
 * Now, your golfml file will display on your website as a scorecard.

== How can I display a personalised scorecard on a web page using Golfml !CourseWriter? ==

 * Make or import a course (e.g. 'mycourse.xml')
 * In the Mode menu, click 'Course + Player Scorecard stylesheet'
 * Click the 'Save all data to Golfml File'
 * Input if prompted the player's name, gender, date of birth and handicap
Use the suggested filename (e.g. 'playerscorecard_mycourse.xml') to save the golfml file to disk
 * On your website, add the saved golfml file and also the following 2 files (available in the source section):
  # playerscorecard.xsl
  # golfml.css
Now, your golfml file will display on your website as a personalised scorecard.

== I want to add a new feature or amenity (advanced feature) ==
If you click Help/About !CourseWriter, on the resulting dialog you will see something like the entry:

(The details depend on your operating system)
