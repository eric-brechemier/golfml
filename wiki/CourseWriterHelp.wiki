== What does Golfml !CourseWriter do? ==

The purpose of the application is to:

  * Write new golfml course definition files
  * Import and display course definition golfml files
  * Import, edit and save course definition golfml files
  * Produce the web files necessary to:
    # Display printable course data for any course in any club.
    # Display a printable personalised scorecard for any player on any course featuring accurate USGA/EGA playing handicap and Stableford allowances.

It does _not_:

  * Read or write golfml player information
  * Read or write golfml match/score information
    * _Warning: If you import a golfml file with course, player and/or score information, and then overwrite it using !CourseWriter, only the course information will be preserved._
== What is a golfml file? ==

It is a plain-text XML file designed to store information about Golf Courses, Golf Players and Golf Matches.

== How can I make a new golfml file? ==

When Golfml !CourseWriter starts up, the first screen gives simple instructions on how to make a new golfml file.

You will need:

  # A scorecard from the Golf Club with the *tees* and *distances*, *!StrokeIndexes* and *Pars* for each hole.  You can sometimes see these published on the web.
  # The *Course Rating* and *Slope Rating* for each tee of each course in the club (it should be on the scorecards; look for the terms 'VC' and 'VS')
  # Details about the Club's *location* and *facilities* offered by the club.

== How can I edit a golfml file? ==

  # On the File menu, click 'Import golfml file...'.  After a short delay, the golfml file data will load.
    * You can then add, delete, change and edit anything you like, and when you are done, click the 'Save all data to golfml file' button.

_Note: If you save the file under the same name you loaded it, the new file will always overwrite the old one._

== Can I change a golfml file myself using a text editor? ==

Yes.  That is one of the strengths of XML as a data format, but it is safer to edit via Golfml !CourseWriter (Menu: File/Import golfml file...)

== How can I display a scorecard on a web page using Golfml !CourseWriter? ==

 * Make or import a course (e.g. 'mycourse.xml')
 * In the Mode menu, click 'Course + Generic Scorecard stylesheet'
 * Click the 'Save all data to Golfml File'  Use the suggested filename (e.g. 'scorecard_mycourse.xml') to save the golfml file to disk
 * On your website, add the saved golfml file and also the following 2 files (available in the source section):
    # coursescorecard.xsl
    # golfml.css
Now, your golfml file will display on your website as a scorecard. ([http://www.charcodelvalle.com/golfmlweb/files/scorecard_tenerife_abamagolf.xml Click Here] to see an example)

== How can I display a personalised scorecard on a web page using Golfml !CourseWriter? ==

  * Make or import a course (e.g. 'mycourse.xml')
  * In the Mode menu, click 'Course + Player Scorecard stylesheet'
  * Click the 'Save all data to Golfml File'
  * Input if prompted the player's name, gender, date of birth and handicap
  * When prompted enter the _exact_ golf course name and tee-colour
  * Use the suggested filename (e.g. 'playerscorecard_mycourse.xml') to save the golfml file to disk
  * On your website, add the saved golfml file and also the following 2 files (available in the source section):
  # playerscorecard.xsl
  # golfml.css
Now, your golfml file will display on your website as a personalised scorecard.  ([http://www.charcodelvalle.com/golfmlweb/files/playerscorecard_tenerife_abamagolf.xml Click Here] to see an example)
