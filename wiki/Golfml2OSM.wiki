The GolfML project includes several sample transformations to interact with related projects.

The Open Street Map initiative is indeed a project of interest as it allows golfer to store golf course information directly in Open Street Map layers of information.

The overall structure of golf course information in a GolfML document looks very much like this:

The GolfML to Open Streep Map transformation convert the above structure into something like this:

Please note that in the above picture, boxes with a dashed line contour do not really exist in the Open Street Map XML document structure.
They are added to easy the reading of the document.
In the XML document, they appears as XML comments.

The transformation from Open Street Map to GolfML is being developed. More information soon.
