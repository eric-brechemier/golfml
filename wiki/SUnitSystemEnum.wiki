			Physical units used in golfml.
			Units are always expressed in the International System of units, using meters, seconds, and kilograms.
			
			However, given the popularity of golf in the United States of America, alternative unit system can be used to prevent
			unit conversions in applications. Therefore, physical values can also be expressed in yards, miles, and pounds.
			Since the Imperial system of units is not the default system for units, it MUST be specified each time it is used.
			
			To further enhance the sharing of data across both unit systems, golfml allows for several values to be given in
			different unit systems for the same object.
