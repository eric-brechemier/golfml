				List of statistics that can be computed for a player or a golf course.
		
					* *3-Putt Avoidance*: PGATOUR: The percent of time 3 or more putts were taken for a hole (total 3-putts, 4-putts, etc./ total holes played). 
				
					* *All-Around Ranking*: PGATOUR: The All Around statistic is computed by totalling a player's rank in each of the following statistics:
					Scoring Leaders, Putting Leaders, Eagle Leaders, Birdie Leaders, Sand Saves, Greens in Regulation,
					Driving Distance and Driving Accuracy..
				
					Putt left after first putt from 10-25 feet.
					This statistic measures the average distance left to the hole after a player's first putt,
					an indicator of his ability to lag the ball close with the putter.
					The large greens and tight aprons at the Open Championship mean players will be putting
					longer-than-average distances as well as many shots they would normally chip or pitch.

					PGATOUR: The Official World Golf Ranking, which is
					endorsed by the four major championships and the five professional tours
					which make up the International Federation of PGA Tours, is issued every
					Monday, following completion of the previous week's tournaments from around
					the world. This statistic is the average number of points earned per event
					in the last 104 weeks. These points are awarded based upon finish position
					as well as the strength of the field. The points are initially worth double
					their original value and decline gradually over this two-year period. There
					are 8 13-week periods and points decline by .25 times their value each period.
				
					* *One Putts*: One Putts.
				
					* *Par 3 Birdie or Better Leaders*: Par 3 Birdie or Better Leaders.
				
					* *Par 3 Performance*: PGATOUR: The total strokes under or over par for all par 3's played.

					started for the FedExCup points race.

					This statistic measures the average distance to the hole a player's ball comes to rest from shots outside of 200 yards.
					This is a good indicator of long-iron skill. Many players will be hitting irons and hybrids off the tee to keep
					the ball in the fairway, translating into longer approach shots into the greens.
				
					* *Putting Average*: Putting Average.
				
					* *Putting from - 10-15'*: Putting from - 10-15'.

					PGATOUR: (PGA TOUR Only) The weighted scoring average which takes the stroke average of the field into account.
					It is computed by adding a player's total strokes to an adjustment and dividing by the total rounds played.
					The adjustment is computed by determining the stroke average of the field for each round played.
					This average is subtracted from par to create an adjustment for each round.
					A player accumulates these adjustments for each round played.
				
					PGATOUR: The percent of time a player was able to get 'up and down' once in a greenside sand bunker (regardless of score).
					Note: 'Up and down' indicates it took the player 2 shots or less to put the ball in the hole from that point.
