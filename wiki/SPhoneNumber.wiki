				Full international telephone number is up to 15 digits long.
				The country code is up to 3 digits long. The area code is
				country-dependent and is not used for some countries. If
				used, it seems to be from 1 to 5 digits long. This leaves
				the subscriber number up to 14 digits. Plus there is the
				optional extension. Putting this all together, we get:
				
				country-area-subscriber-extension
				
				The area code and extension are optional. Here are a few
				examples:
				
				1-800-1234567	(country-area-subscriber)
				1-800-1234567-89 (country-area-subscriber-extension)
				34-912345678	 (country-subscriber)
				34-912345678-9   (country-subscriber-extension)

				Note
				
				We added "start with a + sign" for country code; there should be no space to separate numbers.
