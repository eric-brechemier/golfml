----
=== Purpose ===
This application is a utility that works in collaboration with !CourseWriter's "Make Player Scorecard" mode.

Once a player scorecard golfml file has been made by !CourseWriter, it is for a particular player at a particular handicap on a named course and tee position.

Any of these parameters can change often (especially the handicap) so !PlayerScorecard Updater is a quick utility that enables you to change any of these parameters quickly and easily.
----
==== Why a separate application? ====
It is true that you could use !CourseWriter to do this, but Updater is designed for bulk operation (see below: Scenario 1).
----
=== Operation Scenarios ===
==== Scenario 1 ====

You wish to produce printable online scorecards for 50 golfers for a competition.
  # Use !CourseWriter to make or import the golfml course file.
  # In !CourseWriter "player scorecard" mode, save the golfml course  for the first player using a meaningful filename e.g. _playerscorecard_coursename_playername.xml_
  # Using Updater, import the file.
  # Update the player name and player handicap and tick 'update' for only those 2 items
  # In Updater export the golfml file using the player name in the filename
  # *Without closing Updater*, repeat steps (4) and (5) until you have the 50 golfml files
  # Deploy them on your website with the playerscorecard.xsl and golfml.css files.  They will appear as customised scorecards ( [http://www.charcodelvalle.com/golfmlweb/files/playerscorecard_tenerife_abamagolf.xml click here to see an example])

==== Scenario 2 ====
You have a personal player scorecard golfml file for your home course and wish to update the handicap.

  # Using Updater, import the file, and change the handicap.  Tick 'update' only for the handicap.
  # Export (save) the updated file

That's it!
