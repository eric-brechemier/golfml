= Algorithm =

The Open Streep Map to GolfML conversion requires the respect of Open Street Map for Golf convention.

The algorithm works as follow:

1. Search and locate a osm:relation with both

{{{
      <tag k="leisure" v="golf_course"/>
      <tag k="type" v="golf_course"/>
}}}

The first one ensure we have a golf course, the second one ensure contributors have added golfing data.

Ideally, the relation should contain all osm:way and osm:node of interest.

2. Search for all way's and node's which have 

{{{
      <tag k="golf" v="*"/>
}}}

3. Interpret above ways and nodes.

Recurse and interpret.

4. Organise all collected items per hole (GolfML's driving entity).

5. Generate GolfML.

= Notes =

== Golf Course Data ==

The golf course's name has the structure:

"Country club name, Golf course name"

From tags

sr:* and cr:*

we deduce not only the course's USGA rating and slope, but also all possible tee sets (word after the `: `).

(WORK IN PROGRESS.)
