  * This desktop application enables anyone to enter the details of a Golf Club and all its courses to produce a golfml data file.  It is laid out to resemble a typical score card so that data entry is straightforward and easy.

  * Each golf club data file can have up to 6 courses and caters for up to 6 types of tee position per course.

  * !CourseWriter can also open, edit and save any valid golfml course file.

  * !CourseWriter can also automatically make a golfml file that will display as a general scorecard: ([http://www.charcodelvalle.com/golfmlweb/files/scorecard_tenerife_abamagolf.xml click here] to see an example) or a personalised scorecard with correct Playing handicap and Stableford allowances ([http://www.charcodelvalle.com/golfmlweb/files/playerscorecard_tenerife_abamagolf.xml click here] to see an example) depending on the stylesheet used.
    * !CourseWriter remembers your Name, Course, Tee-Colour and Handicap, making it easy to update your Personal Scorecard for other courses and changes in handicap.
    * The Personal Scorecard is formatted to print and take with you to the course.  Marking your Stableford score and other stats as-you-go is easy!

  * At any time, you can press F1 to see [CourseWriterHelp online help].
